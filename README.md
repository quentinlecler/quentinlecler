### About Me

Full-Stack Developer specialized in **regulated industries** where reliability matters. I build end-to-end solutions for banking and healthcare — two sectors with zero tolerance for bugs.

- 🏥 Healthcare: medical device integrations, patient workflows, multi-site architectures
- 🏦 Banking: credit processing, broker portals, compliance-ready systems
- ⚙️ Approach: clean architecture, pragmatic solutions, ship fast without breaking things
